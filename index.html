    <p>
      CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young
      physicist named Alan Guth, with a new son and a year’s appointment at
      Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and equations, venturing
      far beyond the world of known physics. He was trying to understand why
      there was no trace of some exotic particles that should have been
      created in the Big Bang. Instead he discovered what might have made
      the universe bang to begin with. A potential hitch in the presumed
      course of cosmic evolution could have infused space itself with a
      special energy that exerted a repulsive force, causing the universe to
      swell faster than the speed of light for a prodigiously violent
      instant. If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why
      the heavens look uniform from pole to pole and not like a jagged,
      warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the wrinkles
      and irregularities. Those particles were not missing, but would be
      diluted beyond detection, like spit in the ocean. “SPECTACULAR
      REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page and drew a
      double box around it.<br />
      On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported
      that they had seen the beginning of the Big Bang, and that his
      hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, looked right. Reaching
      back across 13.8 billion years to the first sliver of cosmic time with
      telescopes at the South Pole, a team of astronomers led by John M.
      Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics detected
      ripples in the fabric of space-time — so-called gravitational waves —
      the signature of a universe being wrenched violently apart when it was
      roughly a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second old.
      They are the long-sought smoking-gun evidence of inflation, proof, Dr.
      Kovac and his colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was correct. Unlock more
      free articles. Create an account or log in Inflation has been the
      workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though many, including Dr. Guth,
      wondered whether it could ever be proved. If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s
      work will stand as a landmark in science comparable to the recent
      discovery of dark energy pushing the universe apart, or of the Big
      Bang itself. It would open vast realms of time and space and energy to
      science and speculation. Confirming inflation would mean that the
      universe we see, extending 14 billion light-years in space with its
      hundreds of billions of galaxies, is only an infinitesimal patch in a
      larger cosmos whose extent, architecture and fate are unknowable.
      Moreover, beyond our own universe there might be an endless number of
      other universes bubbling into frothy eternity, like a pot of pasta
      water boiling over.

      <h2>‘As Big as It Gets’</h2>

      <p>
        In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the forces
        operating at energies forever beyond the reach of particle accelerators
        on Earth and yield new insights into gravity itself. Dr. Kovac’s ripples
        would be the first direct observation of gravitational waves, which,
        according to Einstein’s theory of general relativity, should ruffle
        space-time. Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins University, an
        early-universe expert who was not part of the team, said, “This is huge,
        as big as it gets.” He continued, “This is a signal from the very
        earliest universe, sending a telegram encoded in gravitational waves.”
        The ripples manifested themselves as faint spiral patterns in a bath of
        microwave radiation that permeates space and preserves a picture of the
        universe when it was 380,000 years old and as hot as the surface of the
        sun. Dr. Kovac and his collaborators, working in an experiment known as
        Bicep, for Background Imaging of Cosmic Extragalactic Polarization,
        reported their results in a scientific briefing at the Center for
        Astrophysics here on Monday and in a set of papers submitted to The
        Astrophysical Journal.

    <p class="first-image">THE UNIVERSE is just under 14 billion years old. From our position in the Milky Way galaxy,
      we
      can observe a sphere that is now about 92 billion light-years across. But there's a mystery. Wherever we look, the
      universe has an even temperature.</p>

    <p class="second-image">NOT ENOUGH TIME The universe is not old enough for light to have traveled the vast distance
      from one side of the universe to the other, and there has not been enough time for scattered patches of hot and
      cold
      to mix into an even temperature.</p>
    <p class="third-image">DISTANT COFFEE At a smaller scale, imagine using a telescope to look a mile in one direction.
      You see a coffee cup, and from the amount of steam, you can estimate its temperature and how much it has cooled.
    </p>
    <p class="fourth-image">COFFEE EVERYWHERE Now turn around and look a mile in the other direction. You see a similar
      coffee cup, at exactly the same temperature. Coincidence? Maybe. But if you see a similar cup in every direction,
      you might want to look for another explanation.</p>
    <p class="fifth-image">STILL NOT ENOUGH TIME There has not been enough time to carry coffee cups from place to place
      before they get cold. But if all the coffee cups were somehow filled from a single coffee pot, all at the same
      time,
      that might explain their even temperature..</p>
    <p class="sixth-image">INFLATION solves this problem. The theory proposes that, less than a trillionth of a second
      after the Big Bang, the universe expanded faster than the speed of light. Tiny ripples in the violently expanding
      energy field eventually grew into the large-scale structures of the universe.</p>
    <p class="seventh">LUCTUATION Astronomers have now detected evidence of these ancient fluctuations in swirls of
      polarized light in the cosmic background radiation, which is energy left over from the early universe. These are
      gravitational waves predicted by Einstein.</p>
    <p class="eigth">EXPANSION Returning to our coffee, imagine a single, central pot expanding faster than light and
      cooling to an even temperature as it expands. That is something like inflation. And the structure of the universe
      mirrors the froth and foam of the original pot.</p>

      <h3>By LARRY BUCHANAN and JONATHAN CORUM</h3>
      <p>Dr. Kovac said the chance that the results were a fluke was only one in 10 million.

        Dr. Guth, now 67, pronounced himself “bowled over,” saying he had not expected such a definite confirmation in
        his
        lifetime.<br>
        “With nature, you have to be lucky,” he said. “Apparently we have been lucky.”

        The results are the closely guarded distillation of three years’ worth of observations and analysis. Eschewing
        email for fear of a leak, Dr. Kovac personally delivered drafts of his work to a select few, meeting with Dr.
        Guth, who is now a professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (as is his son, Larry, who was sleeping
        that
        night in 1979), in his office last week.

        “It was a very special moment, and one we took very seriously as scientists,” said Dr. Kovac, who chose his
        words
        as carefully as he tended his radio telescopes.

        Andrei Linde of Stanford, a prolific theorist who first described the most popular variant of inflation, known
        as
        chaotic inflation, in 1983, was about to go on vacation in the Caribbean last week when Chao-Lin Kuo, a Stanford
        colleague and a member of Dr. Kovac’s team, knocked on his door with a bottle of Champagne to tell him the news.

    <div class="box-1">

      <p>Confused, Dr. Linde called out to his wife, asking if she had ordered anything.

        “And then I told him that in the beginning we thought that this was a delivery but we did not think that we
        ordered anything, but I simply forgot that actually I did order it, 30 years ago,” Dr. Linde wrote in an email.

        Calling from Bonaire, the Dutch Caribbean island, Dr. Linde said he was still hyperventilating. “Having news
        like
        this is the best way of spoiling a vacation,” he said.

        By last weekend, as social media was buzzing with rumors that inflation had been seen and news spread,
        astrophysicists responded with a mixture of jubilation and caution.

        Max Tegmark, a cosmologist at M.I.T., wrote in an email, “I think that if this stays true, it will go down as
        one
        of the greatest discoveries in the history of science.”

        John E. Carlstrom of the University of Chicago, Dr. Kovac’s mentor and head of a competing project called the
        South Pole Telescope, pronounced himself deeply impressed. “I think the results are beautiful and very
        convincing,” he said.

        Paul J. Steinhardt of Princeton, author of a competitor to inflation that posits the clash of a pair of
        universes
        as the cause of genesis, said that if true, the Bicep result would eliminate his model, but he expressed
        reservations about inflation.

        Lawrence M. Krauss of Arizona State and others also emphasized the need for confirmation, noting that the new
        results exceeded earlier estimates based on temperature maps of the cosmic background by the European Space
        Agency’s Planck satellite and other assumptions about the universe.

        “So we will need to wait and see before we jump up and down,” Dr. Krauss said.

        Corroboration might not be long in coming. The Planck spacecraft will report its own findings this year. At
        least
        a dozen other teams are trying similar measurements from balloons, mountaintops and space.</p>

      <h2>Spirals in the Sky</h2>
      <p>Gravity waves are the latest and deepest secret yet pried out of the cosmic microwaves, which were discovered
        accidentally by Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson at Bell Labs 50 years ago. They won the Nobel Prize.

        Dr. Kovac has spent his career trying to read the secrets of these waves. He is one of four leaders of Bicep,
        which has operated a series of increasingly sensitive radio telescopes at the South Pole, where the thin, dry
        air
        creates ideal observing conditions. The others are Clement Pryke of the University of Minnesota, Jamie Bock of
        the
        California Institute of Technology and Dr. Kuo of Stanford.

        “The South Pole is the closest you can get to space and still be on the ground,” Dr. Kovac said. He has been
        there
        23 times, he said, wintering over in 1994. “I’ve been hooked ever since,” he said.</p>
